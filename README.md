# [Team Noteboard](http://peterze.pythonanywhere.com/)

This is a group noteboard desgined for small businesses. A user can create draggable resizable notes and draw on the public canvas. When a user don't enter anything into the 'name_field' during creation, the task would appear in the public board (the index page where everyone is directed to at beginning). If a user assigns the task to someone by entering into the name field, it won't appear in the public board. But if another user authenicates by clicking 'your_board' and entering their name, they could access tasks assigned to them directly. When a task is finished, a complete button is provided.
