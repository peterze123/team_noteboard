TEAM_TASK_MANAGER
-----
-----

This is a simple group-management app. A user can create a new task and present it to the rest of the group. When a user don't enter anything into the name_field during creation, the task would appear in the public board (the page where everyone is directed to at beginning). If a user assigns the task to someone by entering into the name field, it won't appear in the public board. But if another user clicks 'your_board" and enters their name into the field, they could access tasks assigned to them directly. When a task is finished, a delte function is provided.
